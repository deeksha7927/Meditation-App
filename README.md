<h3>Description</h3>

  GANs are the state-of-the-art machine learning models which can generate new data instances from existing ones. They use a very interesting technique, inspired from the Game   Theory, to generate realistic samples.

In this project, we'll use GANs to colorize a grayscale ( B/W ) image. In addition to that, our generator model will have a structure similar to that of a UNet i.e the one with skip connections.
